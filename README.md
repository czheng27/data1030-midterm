Assessing heart disease and heart attack risk using self-reported health, 
lifestyle, and demographic data (DATA1030, Fall 2023, Brown University)

This final project is the culmination of work conducted in the course DATA1030 
at Brown University for the Fall 2023 semester. The ML models in the project use 
the Heart Disease Health Indicators dataset provided by Alex Teboul on Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset/data) 
to determine if an individual will develop heart disease or have a heart attack 
given certain health, lifetyle, and demographic data. This project consists of EDA 
and model training. The attached yml file elucidates the python and package versions 
used to develop this code.

/data contains all of the data files, /figures contains all of the generated figures, 
/results contains all of the results-related outputs (predictions, saved models, etc), 
/report contains a pdf version of the final course report, and /src contains all of the
source code.
